A Medical Diagnosis AI AI-Driven Personalized Genomic Health Companion Genomic Risk Profiling

The system begins by ingesting a user’s genomic data (e.g. a simulated VCF file) to calculate personalized disease risk. Modern precision medicine uses polygenic risk scores (PRS) – weighted sums of many genetic variants – to predict complex diseases like diabetes, heart disease, or cancer frontiersin.org frontiersin.org . We employ an AI model (e.g. random forests or neural networks) trained on large genomic datasets to capture nonlinear gene interactions. Recent research shows that such AI-driven multi-PRS models significantly outperform classical PRS regression models frontiersin.org frontiersin.org . For example, AI-driven precision medicine can combine genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors to tailor preventive interventions for each individual translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com . The model outputs the user’s top risk conditions (e.g. high risk for type 2 diabetes or coronary disease) based on their genetics, laying the foundation for personalized prevention.

Personalized Prevention Planning

For each identified risk, the agent automatically generates an evidence-based prevention plan. It draws on clinical guidelines and nutrigenomics findings. For example, a user at high cardiovascular risk might see a meal plan rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins (a Mediterranean-style diet) heart.org , plus an exercise goal (e.g. ≥150 minutes/week of moderate aerobic activity) as recommended by the American Heart Association heart.org . For someone at high diabetes risk, the plan might emphasize a low-glycemic diet and set a ~5–7% body-weight reduction goal, reflecting the Diabetes Prevention Program findings ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ncbi.nlm.nih.gov .

Diet & Nutrition: Customized eating plans (Mediterranean, DASH, or low-glycemic diets) aligned with the user’s genetic risk profile heart.org .

Exercise & Activity: Personalized activity targets (daily steps or workouts) scaled to the user’s baseline fitness; moderate-intensity exercise (150–300 min/week) dramatically lowers chronic disease incidence ncbi.nlm.nih.gov heart.org .

Lifestyle Habits: Guidance on stress management, sleep quality, and smoking cessation to mitigate inflammation and synergize with genetic risk factors.

Preventive Therapies: Recommendations for prophylactic treatments (e.g. low-dose aspirin, statins, supplements) when supported by evidence, with checks against the user’s pharmacogenomic markers.

Image: Individuals exercising together outdoors. The plan presents concrete, actionable advice (“Walk 30 minutes five days a week,” “Eat five servings of vegetables daily”), each backed by clinical evidence. It continually adapts: if monitoring shows the user is very sedentary, initial goals are modest and gradually ramp up as fitness improves. In this way, the system translates static genetic risk into a dynamic, personalized lifestyle roadmap.

Continuous Monitoring with Wearable/IoT Sensors

To make prevention adaptive, the companion continuously ingests real-world health data via sensors. In our prototype, an Arduino R3 controls multiple sensors: an AD8232 ECG module and PPG pulse sensor for cardiac signals (heart rate, rhythm, HRV) machinelearning.apple.com ; a MEMS microphone for breathing sounds (coughs or snoring); an ultrasonic sensor on the chest to estimate breathing rate; and a moisture sensor on the skin to approximate perspiration/hydration. The HC-05 Bluetooth module sends these time-stamped data to a connected smartphone or cloud server for processing.

Cloud algorithms continuously analyze this streaming data to compute health metrics (e.g. resting heart rate, sleep quality inferred from breathing, daily activity levels) and detect anomalies. This mirrors modern wearable-health research: devices like smartwatches can flag early warning signs (irregular heartbeats, stress spikes) through continuous tracking nilebits.com nilebits.com . For example, an unexplained spike in resting heart rate or a prolonged drop in daily step count could trigger a warning.

Drift Detection and Proactive Alerts

Subtle health trends often precede symptoms, so the AI includes drift and anomaly detectors. The user’s normal range is learned over time, and new data are compared against this baseline. If a metric drifts beyond normal variation (e.g. fasting glucose steadily rising or blood pressure creeping up), the system issues an early alert. For example, it might display: “Fasting glucose has trended upward this week. This suggests worsening insulin resistance. Consider dietary adjustments or a doctor’s visit. Clinical studies show that losing 5–7% of body weight can dramatically improve glucose control ncbi.nlm.nih.gov .”

Image: Laboratory test tubes for biomarker analysis. The companion also integrates periodic lab results (simulated in our demo). If an annual check-up shows high LDL-C or HbA1c, those values immediately update the risk profile and can trigger plan revisions. In the user interface (smartphone app or OLED), health trends and alerts appear on intuitive dashboards (charts of recent vitals, risk meters, etc.), emphasizing actionable advice and recommended follow-ups rather than raw numbers or alarms. This continuous feedback loop keeps the user informed and proactive about small changes in their health.

Adaptive AI Health Agent (Continuous Learning)

The AI agent continually learns and personalizes over time. New data – lifestyle changes, new sensor patterns, or updated genomic insights – retrain or fine-tune the risk model. We use explainable AI (XAI) techniques so recommendations are transparent: for instance, a prompt might say, “Insufficient sleep contributed 25% to your elevated blood pressure today, so prioritize rest.” The user’s response (e.g. following the advice) feeds back into the model for further refinement.

Technically, the system is hybrid edge/cloud. A lightweight model on the Arduino (or connected phone) handles immediate threshold checks and instant prompts, while the full predictive model and periodic retraining run in the cloud. This edge-AI approach aligns with recent research on real-time health AI nature.com . In principle, federated learning could be added so the model improves from anonymized data across users without sharing raw data. In sum, the companion doesn’t just compute risk once – it continuously co-evolves with the user’s data and behavior.

Prototype Implementation for Hackathon

In the 24-hour prototype, we demonstrate a functioning version of this vision. The Arduino and sensors form a “health patch”: ECG and PPG sensors on a chest strap (capturing cardiac signals), with the microphone and ultrasonic sensor adjacent, and the moisture sensor contacting the skin. The HC-05 streams data wirelessly to a laptop running our AI code, and the OLED displays real-time vitals or alert icons. We creatively repurpose the remaining hardware: for example, the MG90S servo could dispense a pill on cue, the 4WD chassis (with L298) could serve as a mobile assistant (e.g. following the user), and the 5V relay could activate an environment device (lamp or fan) as needed.

Since real patient data aren’t available in 24 hours, we simulate inputs. We preload a test VCF with known risk variants and generate synthetic biometric streams (ECG waveforms, heart-rate time series, lab values) via code. The laptop backend (using Python/ML libraries) processes the genomic data to compute baseline risk, then continuously ingests the simulated sensor feeds to update its predictions. A web/mobile dashboard presents the user’s polygenic risk scores, live vital charts, and personalized action steps in real time.

Innovation: This solution is novel and futuristic because it fuses genomics, AI, and IoT into a single preventive-health ecosystem. Rather than a static risk report, the user gets an evolving interactive “health coach” that learns from genes and daily life. By leveraging commonplace health sensors and state-of-the-art AI (deep learning models, edge computing, explainability), it realizes proactive precision care. All recommendations are grounded in clinical evidence ncbi.nlm.nih.gov heart.org , and the working prototype demonstrates how genomics and sensor data can drive health decisions in practice.
